This program calculates the probability of a given battle in Risk Europe, based on the running of a large number of simulations. Based in CMD, this program takes in user inputs describing the amount of troops on each side, as well as number of simulations. The program is able to run 1,000,000 simulations with little to no wait. Outcomes for each simulation are counted (draws, attacker wins, defender wins), then divided by total number of simulations to give a result. To run program, run the main file
